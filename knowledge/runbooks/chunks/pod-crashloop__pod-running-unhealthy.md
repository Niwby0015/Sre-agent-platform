#### My pod is running but not doing what I told it to do

If your pod is not behaving as you expected, it may be that there was an error in your
pod description (e.g. `mypod.yaml` file on your local machine), and that the error
was silently ignored when you created the pod.  Often a section of the pod description
is nested incorrectly, or a key name is typed incorrectly, and so the key is ignored.
For example, if you misspelled `command` as `commnd` then the pod will be created but
will not use the command line you intended it to use.

The first thing to do is to delete your pod and try creating it again with the `--validate` option.
For example, run `kubectl apply --validate -f mypod.yaml`.
If you misspelled `command` as `commnd` then will give an error like this:

```shell
I0805 10:43:25.129850   46757 schema.go:126] unknown field: commnd
I0805 10:43:25.129973   46757 schema.go:129] this may be a false alarm, see https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/6842
pods/mypod
```

The next thing to check is whether the pod on the apiserver
matches the pod you meant to create (e.g. in a yaml file on your local machine).
For example, run `kubectl get pods/mypod -o yaml > mypod-on-apiserver.yaml` and then
manually compare the original pod description, `mypod.yaml` with the one you got
back from apiserver, `mypod-on-apiserver.yaml`. There will typically be some
lines on the "apiserver" version that are not on the original version. This is
expected. However, if there are lines on the original that are not on the apiserver
version, then this may indicate a problem with your pod spec.
